# C# HTTP Server

This is a basic HTTP server implementation from scratch made for the CodeCrafters "Build Your Own HTTP Server" challenge.

## What I Learned

### Built-In C# Libraries

- **System.Net and System.Net.Sockets**: Used for creating TCP listeners and handling network streams.
- **System.Threading**: Used threading and tasks to support multiple, concurrent requests.
- **System.Text**: Used for encoding and decoding text data.
- **System.IO**: Used for file operations.
- **System.IO.Compression**: Used for compressing data streams.

### HTTP Concepts

- **HTTP Methods**: Implemented basic handling for GET and POST requests.
- **Headers**: Learned how to parse and use HTTP headers.
- **Status Codes**: Learned some new HTTP status codes like 405 Method Not Allowed.
- **Content Encoding**: Implemented support for gzip content encoding.

### C# Features

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Used `async` and `await` for asynchronous IO operations.
- **LINQ**: Used LINQ for string manipulation and collection operations.
- **File Handling**: Learned how to read from and write to files.
